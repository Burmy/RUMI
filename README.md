## What is RUMI
According to an ACS Data study, the city of San Francisco is home to the highest percentage of 18-39 year olds living with roommates. At 28%, the number of young adults living with roommates in the San Francisco Bay Area exceeds that of any other city in the United States. Previously, searching for an apartment to rent or finding a compatible roommate would take countless hours browsing social media housing groups and unorganized forms online. The city of San Francisco and the larger surrounding Bay Area has long called for a reliable solution. 

This is why our team has built RUMI - the new age digital housing solution providing a seamless transition into life in the Bay Area. RUMI is a web-based application helping students and young professionals alike find rooms and rent apartments around the San Francisco Bay Area. With RUMI, roommates no longer need to copy/paste their listing specifications countless times in online groups, discussion forms, and insecure sites online.
