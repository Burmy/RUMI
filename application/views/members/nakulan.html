                Hey guys! My name is Nakulan and I am a Third-Year Computer Science student at San Francisco State University.
                I am passionate about application and web development, and I enjoy developing new products that cater to a wide 
                range of consumer interests. I am interested in learning new technologies and being at the forefront 
                of new discoveries/breakthroughs in the field of Computer Science. In my free-time, I enjoy reading, playing 
                badminton, working out, playing video games, and coding.
