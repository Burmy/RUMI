          <p>Hey there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jasmine, a software engineering & math student at SFSU passionate about technology driven change. <br> <br> As a technologist, I'm fueled by an affinity for learning and a conviction that technology is here to serve people, not manipulate them nor monotize their attention. I'm driven to building products and designing solutions that serve people and communitites on a global scale. <br><br> I'm constantly intrested in new ideas and looking for ways I could be helpful. Currently, I'm reading <em> Give & Take</em>, <em>Atomic Habits</em>, and <em>the War of Art</em>. Say hello at anytime <a href = "mailto: hello@yasmine.dev">hello@yasmine.dev</a></p>
